FOR THE PROFESSORS CORRECTING THIS:
There are a few video files that refused to upload due to the size limitations of github. So will just share the link with you here.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKeSTiG85xqh4WON5oKnmJCtGuPUH6ma/view?usp=sharing That is the menu video. Due to our design choices, this video being missing is a bit problematic as you cannot see the menu anymore. so when playing the game through the engine, please make sure to load the level directly from the maps section. I attempted to fix this, however, GitHub glitched and refused to work as i wanted it to do
